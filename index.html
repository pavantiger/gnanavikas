      <div class="modal-body">
       <p class="lead"> Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji (1945-2013) succeeded Sri Sri Sri Ramanandanath Mahaswamiji and inherited the Natha lineage as early as at thirty years of age on the auspicious day of 24th September 1974.  He became a seer of the Adichunchanagiri Math, inspired by the desire to serve the country men and thread the path of Spirituality took initiation at the age of 19 and acquired the knowledge of Vedas, Upanishads and ancient Indian scriptures under the tutelage of Sri Sri Sri Ramanandanath Mahaswamiji as his Guru.  He became the 71st pontiff of the Adichunchangiri Dharma Peetha and worked tirelessly to realize his vision of revolutionalising the Society through Spiritual, Educational, Social, Cultural activities of the Math. He travelled all round the World and the country understanding the needs of the people. Having comprehended the prime requisites of this hour he plunged to take up various initiatives aiming at the integral development and progress of the nation. This objective could be achieved only by involving in Jnana and Karma Paths, as described in the famous scripture of Bhagavadgita. The Swamiji as a true Sanyasi dedicated the whole of his life for service to others/Society at large (Paropakarartham Ido Shariramâ€¦). 
	      </p><br>
<p class="lead">His Holiness was truly an enlightened and realized soul for he treated all the people alike, without discriminating on the basis of caste, creed, sex or status. His approach towards handling different problems was truly scientific and logical. He implicitly understood the importance of Education to the masses in alleviation of poverty. This led to the establishment of Sri Adichunchanagiri Shikshana Trust formed in 1973, through which several Educational institutions and schools have been set up. At present 450 + such schools are functioning across the State/Nation aiding the Government in educating the rural and semi rural children. This campaign of Jnana Dasoha ranges from providing primary education to the rural poor to making available professional education to meritorious students.  Also Mahaswamiji has made free boarding and lodging facilities for Civil services aspirants in the premises of the Math at Vijayanagar campus in Bangalore. 
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">He not only emphasized modern system of Education but also advocated traditional Teaching systems. Having studied Sanskrit and acquired Vedic knowledge under the tutelage of his Guru, he knew the importance for reviving of Sanskrit knowledge which resulted in setting up of Sanskrit colleges at different places. Here along with the traditional knowledge of Sanskrit language, research activities are also carried out. Young monks and seers of different religions are provided free lodging facilities and involve themselves in the study and research of Sanskrit, Vedas, Agamas and many more ancient Indian scriptures.    
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">Further he also stressed upon utilizing indigenous systems of Medicine and Healing by starting up the Ayurvedic Hospital at Bangalore. The premises of Adichunchangiri Mahasamstana is not only a place for scenic beauty and ascetic importance but also is an abode of various medicinal herbs which have magical healing properties. 
H H Mahswamiji, was a great visionary with a perfect blend of science and spirituality. Though he was involved in diversified activities and had a busy schedule he would ensure some time to carry out routine religious rites and meditate to internalize himself. This would revitalize him to pursue divergent Social activities. 
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">The benevolence and equanimity of Mahaswamiji is evident by the gesture of establishing orphanages and care centers for destitute women and children. Women in distress are provided succor by training them in various skills and vocational activities to earn their livelihood. Centers for care and treatment of mentally challenged and geriatric individuals have been set up. 
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">Tertiary cares Hospitals, popular as BGS Global, BGS Apollo have been started at Bangalore and Mysore wherein expensive investigations and surgeries are performed at reasonable rates. Two Medical colleges have been started with the state at BG Nagara and Bangalore and are functioning for providing medical education to worthy students. Four Engineering colleges, six colleges in Allied Health sciences and so on are established imparting professional education. 
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">His Holiness Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadaranatha Mahaswamiji is a patriot in real sense for he took up disaster management and rescue activities whenever calamities struck in any part of the country. The Math provided free food grains clothing and essential drugs to the victims of calamities.  They were given medical aid at times of infliction from earthquakes, cyclones etc.  
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">On seeing the episodes of severe draught as well as cyclones striking different parts of India. Mahaswamiji thought of Go-Green Earth movement . He aimed at achieving one person one plant theme which resulted in planting of around five lakh trees today in and around Bangalore. He having the knowledge of India being an agricultural country envisioned progress of the Nation only by preserving the environment and Eco friendly approach of neo development. Establishment of Goshalas, Vanamahotsava, Jalavardhana programme were all the results of his concern for society, human beings and animals. Annual Krishi Vignana Melas were organized by the math to educate the farmers about novel scientific farming techniques. 
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">His humane touch alleviated woes and distresses of many people who viewed him as a realized Jagadguru and savior of masses. Many titles and honors were conferred on him but his humbleness only added on to his glory and pomp. The Mahaswamiji mingled without any discrimination with the local people and participated in Utsavs, Jathas. Personality development & women empowerment programmes were conducted and also Mass marriages, free Health camps, counseling services were also conducted by the Math.  
  </p><br>
<p class="lead">It is the collective responsibility of the community to continue and preserve the devoted services of His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji , during whose era the math reached the maximum grandeur. Persevered efforts of this 71st pontiff should be the ideal for the forth coming successors to work for Humanity selflessly and exhibit more zeal than before in achieving the dreams and visions of the former come to reality.

        <p class="lead">Sri Sri Sri Dr.Nirmalanandanath maha swamiji, heading  Sri Adhichunchangiri Mahasamsthana as  its 72nd pontiff. He follows the foot steps outlined by his predecessor with a we and Envision for continuing the good works carried out by math.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Sri Sri Sri Nirmalanandanatha Mahaswamiji an ardent follower of Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji hails from a Small village in Gubbi Taluk of Tumkur District. After his early schooling he joined Government. Polytechnic college, Tumkur and passed his Diploma with Distinction securing 7th Rank for the State. Later he passed his graduation in Civil Engineering from National Institute of Engineering, Mysore and did his M.Tech in Structural Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai. Mahaswamiji unlike other youngsters had orientation towards spiritual and service activities rather than materialistic happenings. This attracted him to volunteer teaching at the blind school in Archakanahalli, Ramanagar district. He also alike his Guru believes and enjoys in working for the Society, upliftment of the downtrodden and shares similar views to the former. Mahaswamiji took to ascetic renounced life in 1998 and underwent proper training in traditional knowledge systems.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">He has mastered the Devabhasha (divine language) of Sanskrit and has also learnt Advaitha school of philosophy propounded by Adiguru Sri Shankaracharya. His unquenched thirst for knowledge is evident from his attitude in conferences and functions wherein he enjoys listening to the discourses on Vedas and other shastras as a student rather than as a head of one of the glorious Math.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">The present Mahaswamiji before being chosen to succeed the Siddha Simhasana was appointed by the former Mahaswamiji to head the Shaka (branch) Math at  Chikkaballapur. His selfless service and involvement in the activities of the math impacted on the Guru to adopt Sri Nirmalanandanatha Swamiji as his rightful heir and occupy the responsible post of heading Sri Adichunchanagiri Mahasamstana Math. A true leader is one who focuses on the collective progress rather than concentrating on individual gains. The present Mahaswamiji is immensely influenced by the preaching of Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and teachings of Swami Vivekananda. He in addition to advocating the Jnana and Karma path of Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji, fervently believes in integral development through adherence to Raja yoga, the path advocated by Swami Vivekananda.  In pursuance of the same Mahaswamiji has convened the Foundation for Unity of Religious and enlightened Citizens (FUREC) and is actively associated with the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha, confederation of Indian Spiritual movement activities. His writings reflect his revolutionary thoughts of converging all the divergent efforts of the Adichunchangiri Math towards reviving of Sanatana Hindu Dharma and secluding all the myths and superstitious beliefs in the Society which are misleading & diluting the energies of present generations. His Holiness is actively involved in counseling activities and guide the ones who have a strayed and beguiled from the righteous path.  He is the ideal example for present day youth who try to mimic the shallow western culture disregarding our rich values, as a influence of modern education.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">The Swamiji envisages several plans for expanding the activities taken up by his Guru, enlisting a few below as:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishment of Medical colleges</li>
          <li>Advocating bio-friendly energy systems</li>
